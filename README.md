# Nelson_Siegel

Nelson_Siegel model is mainly used for yield curve fitting, and is a method used in fixed income analysis to estimate the term structure of interest rates, which is also known as the yield curve. The yield curve represents the relationship between the yields of bonds (typically government bonds) and their maturities. Accurate yield curve estimation is crucial for pricing bonds, managing interest rate risk, and valuing derivatives.

The yield curve is a graph that plots interest rates (yields) of bonds with equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. The x-axis represents the bond's maturity, and the y-axis represents the yield.
Term Structure of Interest Rates:

The term structure of interest rates describes how the yield on bonds changes with different maturities. It is essential for understanding the pricing of fixed income securities.

Yield Curve Fitting:
Yield curve fitting involves using mathematical models to fit a smooth curve to observed yields. This allows for the estimation of yields at any maturity, even if those maturities are not directly observed in the market.

1. Nelson-Siegel Model
The Nelson-Siegel model is a popular approach to fitting the yield curve. The yield y(t) at maturity 
t is given by:
y(t) = beta0 + beta1 * (1 - exp(-t / tau)) / (t / tau) + beta2 * ((1 - exp(-t / tau)) / (t / tau) - exp(-t / tau))
Where:
beta0 is the long-term interest rate level.
beta1 controls the short-term component (slope) of the curve.
beta2 controls the medium-term component (curvature) of the curve.
tau is a decay factor that determines how quickly the effects of beta1 and beta2 diminish over time.

3. Yield Estimation Using Nelson-Siegel
Once the model parameters (beta0, beta1, beta2, tau) are fitted to the observed yields, the yield for any maturity t can be estimated using:
y(t) = beta0 + beta1 * (1 - exp(-t / tau)) / (t / tau) + beta2 * ((1 - exp(-t / tau)) / (t / tau) - exp(-t / tau))
This equation allows you to estimate the yield for any bond maturity based on the fitted parameters.

3. Curve Fitting Process
The parameters beta0, beta1, beta2, and tau are typically estimated by minimizing the difference between the observed yields and the yields predicted by the Nelson-Siegel model. This can be done using non-linear optimization techniques, such as least squares fitting.


Imagine you have observed yields for bonds with maturities of 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years. You can use the Nelson-Siegel model to fit a curve to these observed yields. Once the curve is fitted, you can estimate the yield for any maturity within or beyond the observed range.

Input Observed Data:
Use observed yields and their corresponding maturities.
Fit the Model:
Use a curve fitting technique to estimate the parameters beta0, beta1, beta2, and tau.
Estimate Yields:
Apply the fitted Nelson-Siegel equation to estimate yields for any desired maturity.
